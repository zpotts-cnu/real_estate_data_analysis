# real_estate_data_analysis
Pulling Real Estate Assessment Data from my county's API to ingest and analysis associated metrics.

#### Folder Structure
I am trying out a new folder structure to see if I like it. I created the utilities, dev, and test folders under src to allow ALL of my code to appear under src.

### Dev Log
#### 10/19/2023 - Project Creation
I am trying out a new folder structure to see if I like it. I created the utilities, dev, and test folders under src to allow ALL of my code to appear under src.

Please see below for the changes:
* Created .gitignore
* Created folder structure
* Created sample data from anonymized real data
* Hiding endpoint URLs in resources folder to obscure where I live :)
  * I'll provide a sample structure, so you have an idea what that URLs look like. Though, I imagine other places don't have similar tools that would allow this to work with other localities.
